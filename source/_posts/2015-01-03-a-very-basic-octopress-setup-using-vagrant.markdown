Setting up Octopress can be tricky, especially on Windows systems. Using a Vagrant powered virtual machine instead, we are only one command away from a blogging environment ready-to-go. Run from the directory of the Vagrantfile `vagrant up` will create a VirtualBox Image with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.


``` ruby Vagrantfile for Octopress Setup https://github.com/johker/octopress_vagrant/blob/master/Vagrantfile github
VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION = "2"
Vagrant.configure(VAGRANTFILE_API_VERSION) do |config|
	config.vm.box = "octopress" 
  	config.vm.box_url = "https://github.com/kraksoft/vagrant-box-ubuntu/releases/download/14.04/ubuntu-14.04-amd64.box"
  	config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.34.10"  	
	config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
	    v.memory = 2048
	end  
	config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "scripts/octopress.sh"  	
  	config.vm.synced_folder "posts/", "/opt/octopress/source/_posts/"    
end
```

The setup is done by shell provisioning by including  `octopress.sh` the folder `/scripts` relative to the Vagrantfile. The folder `/posts` is used to access the `.markdown` files generated by ´rake new post´. The files can be edited with an IDE on the host being automatically synced into the guest machine by _Vagrant_.
